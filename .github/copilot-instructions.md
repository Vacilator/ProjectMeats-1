# Developer & Copilot Coding Agent Instructions  
## ProjectMeats – Repository Maintenance, PR Automation, and Coding Standards

**Tech Stack**: Django 5.x + DRF + PostgreSQL | React 19 + TypeScript 5.9 | React Native | Shared-Schema Multi-tenancy

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES (READ FIRST)

### 🚨 ARCHITECTURAL GUARDRAILS (STRICT - DO NOT HALLUCINATE)

**These rules are ABSOLUTE. Any violation indicates a hallucination or outdated knowledge:**

#### 1. TENANCY: Shared Schema Isolation (tenant_id ForeignKey)
**ProjectMeats uses SHARED SCHEMA multi-tenancy. NEVER use or suggest django-tenants patterns:**

**🚫 ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS (ZERO TOLERANCE):**
- ❌ **NEVER** suggest `django-tenants` package or any schema-based isolation library
- ❌ **NEVER** use `django-tenants` mixins (`TenantMixin`, `DomainMixin`)
- ❌ **NEVER** use `schema_context()` or `connection.schema_name` or any schema switching
- ❌ **NEVER** use `migrate_schemas`, `migrate --shared`, or `migrate --tenant` commands
- ❌ **NEVER** suggest separate public/tenant schemas or schema-per-tenant patterns
- ❌ **NEVER** reference PostgreSQL schemas for tenant isolation
- ❌ **NEVER** use `DATABASE_ROUTERS` for tenant routing
- ❌ **NEVER** suggest `TENANT_MODEL` or `TENANT_DOMAIN_MODEL` settings
- ❌ **NEVER** implement schema-based multi-tenancy in any form

**✅ REQUIRED PATTERNS (MANDATORY):**
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use `tenant` ForeignKey on ALL business models
- ✅ **ALWAYS** strictly filter by `.filter(tenant=request.tenant)` in ALL ViewSets
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use standard `python manage.py migrate` (ONLY this command)
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use shared PostgreSQL `public` schema for all tenants
- ✅ **ALWAYS** rely on `TenantMiddleware` for tenant resolution
- ✅ **ALWAYS** assign `tenant=request.tenant` in `perform_create()` methods

**🔍 VERIFICATION TEST:**
If you are suggesting ANY of the following, you are HALLUCINATING and must STOP:
- "django-tenants" package installation
- Schema creation or migration per tenant
- Schema switching or routing logic
- Separate database schemas for isolation
- `migrate_schemas` or similar commands
- Any reference to `docs/archive/` content as current practice

**Why This Matters:** Archived documentation has been deleted as of January 2026 to prevent AI confusion. If you see references to `django-tenants` or schema isolation anywhere, you're reading stale content from a REJECTED design that no longer exists in the repository.

#### 2. FRONTEND: Vite Build System (Migration In Progress)
**ProjectMeats is MIGRATING to Vite for frontend builds. Current state uses react-app-rewired as a temporary bridge.**

**🎯 CURRENT STATE (Temporary - DO NOT ENHANCE):**
- Frontend currently uses `react-app-rewired` with CRA base
- This is a TRANSITIONAL setup - DO NOT add new CRA-specific configurations
- DO NOT enhance or extend react-app-rewired setup
- DO NOT add new REACT_APP_* environment variables

**🚫 PROHIBITED (NEVER SUGGEST):**
- ❌ **NEVER** suggest migrating back to pure `react-scripts`
- ❌ **NEVER** suggest removing react-app-rewired before Vite migration
- ❌ **NEVER** suggest `craco` as alternative to react-app-rewired
- ❌ **NEVER** reference `npm run eject`
- ❌ **NEVER** add new CRA-specific webpack configurations

**✅ FUTURE STATE (Target Architecture - USE FOR NEW CODE):**
- ✅ **ALWAYS** write new code compatible with Vite patterns
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use `import.meta.env` for new environment variables (Vite-ready)
- ✅ **ALWAYS** plan for VITE_* environment variable names
- ✅ **ALWAYS** reference Vite documentation for build questions
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use ES modules and modern import/export syntax

**🔄 MIGRATION STATUS:**
- Backend: ✅ 100% - Using standard Django (NO django-tenants)
- Frontend: 🔄 0% - Still on react-app-rewired (Vite migration pending)
- Documentation: ✅ 100% - Updated to reflect target architecture

**Why This Matters:** We are moving AWAY from CRA ecosystem. Don't invest in CRA-specific solutions. Write Vite-compatible code even if currently running on CRA.

#### 3. SECRET MANAGEMENT: Environment Manifest (Single Source of Truth)
**ProjectMeats uses a manifest-based configuration system. NEVER guess secret names or hardcode environment variables.**

**🚫 ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS (ZERO TOLERANCE):**
- ❌ **NEVER** hardcode secret names without checking `config/env.manifest.json`
- ❌ **NEVER** assume secret naming patterns (e.g., "it's probably DEV_*")
- ❌ **NEVER** create `.env.example` files with hardcoded values
- ❌ **NEVER** document secrets in README files or comments
- ❌ **NEVER** reference archived documentation for secret configuration
- ❌ **NEVER** suggest creating secrets without running the audit first

**✅ REQUIRED PATTERNS (MANDATORY):**
- ✅ **ALWAYS** read `config/env.manifest.json` first for secret names
- ✅ **ALWAYS** run `python config/manage_env.py audit` before deployment changes
- ✅ **ALWAYS** check both environment-specific AND global secrets
- ✅ **ALWAYS** follow the manifest's `ci_secret_mapping` for exact names
- ✅ **ALWAYS** reference `docs/CONFIGURATION_AND_SECRETS.md` for secret management

**🔍 VERIFICATION TEST:**
If you are suggesting ANY of the following, you are HALLUCINATING and must STOP:
- Guessing secret names like "DB_PASSWORD" without checking the manifest
- Creating environment variables without manifest definition
- Referencing `GITHUB_SECRETS_CONFIGURATION.md` (archived)
- Suggesting secret names that don't match manifest patterns
- Adding secrets to GitHub without audit validation

**Authority**: `config/env.manifest.json` (v3.3) is the **Single Source of Truth** for:
- All 6 environments (dev/uat/prod × backend/frontend)
- Every environment variable and its GitHub Secret mapping
- Legacy exceptions (STAGING_*, SSH_PASSWORD sharing)

**Quick Reference:**
```bash
# Check for missing secrets BEFORE making changes
python config/manage_env.py audit

# View current manifest
cat config/env.manifest.json | jq

# List environment secrets
gh secret list --env dev-backend
```

**Why This Matters:** Secret drift causes deployment failures. The manifest prevents inconsistencies by defining ALL secrets in one place. If documentation conflicts with the manifest, **the manifest is always correct**.

### Deployment Rules

**NEVER push changes directly to `uat` or `main` branches. Always follow the promotion workflow:**

1. Create feature/fix branch from `development`
2. Submit PR to `development` with review
3. After merge to `development`, automated workflow creates PR to `UAT`
4. Test and review in UAT environment
5. After merge to `UAT`, automated workflow creates PR to `main`
6. Final approval deploys to production

**Violations of this workflow can break the deployment pipeline and production environment.**

See [Branch Organization & Workflow](#-branch-organization-naming-tagging-and-promotion) for full details.

## 🏢 Multi-Tenancy Architecture

**ALL tenants share ONE PostgreSQL schema. Tenant isolation is via `tenant_id` foreign keys.**

### Key Principles

- **Single Schema**: All data lives in the `public` PostgreSQL schema
- **ForeignKey Isolation**: Business models (`Supplier`, `Customer`, `PurchaseOrder`, etc.) have a `tenant` ForeignKey
- **Tenant Context**: `TenantMiddleware` sets `request.tenant` from domain/header/user
- **ViewSet Pattern**: Filter querysets with `tenant=request.tenant` and assign tenant on creation
- **Standard Migrations**: Use `python manage.py migrate` (NOT `migrate_schemas`)

### Tenant Resolution Order

1. `X-Tenant-ID` header (explicit API selection)
2. Domain match via `TenantDomain` model
3. Subdomain matching (`tenant.slug`)
4. Authenticated user's default tenant

## 🚩 Branch Organization, Naming, Tagging, and Promotion

- **Branch Structure:**  
  Use three main branches following GitFlow-inspired workflow:
  - `development` (all features/fixes/experiments start + merge here)
  - `UAT` (staging; only code tested/reviewed in dev gets promoted here)
  - `main` (production; only code signed off in UAT is promoted here)

  See [Branch Workflow Checklist](../branch-workflow-checklist.md) for diagrams and step-by-step workflow.

- **Branch Naming Conventions:**  
  ```
  feature/<concise-topic>          # New features
  fix/<bug-topic>                  # Bugfixes
  chore/<infra-maintenance>        # Tooling, infra or CI
  refactor/<module>                # Refactoring
  hotfix/<emergency-topic>         # Emergency quick fixes
  docs/<documentation-topic>       # Documentation updates
  test/<test-topic>                # Test improvements
  perf/<performance-topic>         # Performance optimizations
  ```
  - Use lowercase/hyphens; prefix by type for scanning.
  - **CRITICAL**: Never work or merge directly in `main` or `UAT`.
  - **CRITICAL**: Never push changes directly to `uat` or `main` branches.
  - Keep branches focused and short-lived (< 2 weeks active).

- **Deployment Protection Rules (MUST FOLLOW):**
  1. **Always start with feature/fix branch** from `development`
  2. **Merge to `development` first** via Pull Request with review
  3. **Automated PR to `UAT`** triggers after merge to development (via `promote-dev-to-uat.yml`)
  4. **Review and test in UAT** environment before approval
  5. **Automated PR to `main`** triggers after merge to UAT (via `promote-uat-to-main.yml`)
  6. **Final review and deploy to production** only after UAT sign-off
  
  **Workflow Enforcement**:
  - ✅ feature/fix branch → development (via PR)
  - ✅ development → UAT (automated PR after success)
  - ✅ UAT → main (automated PR after success)
  - ❌ NEVER: Direct push to UAT
  - ❌ NEVER: Direct push to main
  - ❌ NEVER: Skip development branch
  - ❌ NEVER: Bypass automated promotion workflows

- **Tagging & Releases:**  
  - Tag major/minor releases in `main` using semantic versioning: `vX.Y.Z`
  - Pre-release tags: `vX.Y.Z-alpha.N`, `vX.Y.Z-beta.N`, `vX.Y.Z-rc.N`
  - Environment tags: `vX.Y.Z-dev`, `vX.Y.Z-uat`
  - Use annotated tags for official releases: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"`
  - Follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/): MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
  - Remove obsolete tags/branches as part of monthly repo maintenance.

- **Branch Protection:**  
  - Enable branch protection in GitHub settings: require status checks, reviews, restrict force-pushes/deletes on `main`, `UAT`, `development`.
  - Require at least 1 approval for PRs to `development`, 2 for `UAT` and `main`.
  - Enforce linear history (no merge commits) on protected branches.
  - Require CI/CD checks to pass before merge.

## 💡 Auto-PR Creation for Environment Promotion (via GitHub Actions)

Auto-promotion between environments is implemented in `.github/workflows/` with workflows like below:

> **Note**: All environment promotion PRs are managed **exclusively** by the superior workflows (`promote-dev-to-uat.yml` and `promote-uat-to-main.yml`). These workflows automatically close any existing stale PRs before creating a new one to ensure only the latest changes are promoted. No other workflow files should be used for this purpose.

**Example**: Promote changes from `development` → `UAT` automatically after merge:

```yaml name=.github/workflows/promote-dev-to-uat.yml
name: Promote Dev to UAT

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - development
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  create-uat-pr:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Create Pull Request to UAT
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v5
        with:
          source-branch: development
          destination-branch: uat
          title: 'Promote development to UAT'
          body: |
            Auto-created PR to promote tested changes from development to UAT environment.
          labels: uat-promotion, automation
          reviewers: Vacilator
```

Repeat similarly for `UAT` → `main`.

**Key Features of Superior Promotion Workflows:**
- **Automatic Stale PR Management**: Before creating a new PR, the workflow checks for and closes any existing open PRs between the same branches, preventing duplicate or conflicting PRs
- **Fresh Promotion**: Each workflow run creates a PR with the latest commits from the source branch
- **Manual Trigger Support**: Workflows can be triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch` in addition to automatic triggers on branch pushes
- **Reviewer Assignment**: Automatically assigns reviewers (e.g., `Vacilator`) for accountability

**Workflow Requirements:**
- Ensure only fast-forward, conflict-free merges
- PR is auto-created, not auto-merged (review/approval required, CI must pass)
- Template body should clearly state promotion reason/scope
- Configure branch protection to prevent unintended merges

## 📄 Documentation, File Placement, Standards & Logging

- **Documentation Structure:**  
  - Main guides: `/docs/` directory and root `README.md`
  - API documentation: with module code (`backend/apps/<app>/docs/`, `frontend/docs/`)
  - Architecture decisions: `/docs/architecture/` using ADR (Architecture Decision Records) format
  - Workflow/process: `/docs/workflows/` (branch flow, environments, CI/CD)
  - Archived/deprecated: `/archived/docs/` with migration notes
  - Use visual aids: diagrams (`mermaid`/PlantUML), flowcharts, sequence diagrams
  - Include code examples, usage patterns, and common pitfalls

- **Documentation Quality Standards:**
  - Every public API endpoint must have OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
  - Complex business logic requires inline comments explaining "why", not "what"
  - README files in each major directory explaining purpose and structure
  - Update docs in the same PR as code changes (not separately)
  - Use consistent markdown formatting (linting with markdownlint)
  - Include table of contents for docs > 200 lines
  - Add "Last Updated" dates to documentation

- **Copilot Logging:**  
  - After each PR/task, add to `copilot-log.md`:
    ```markdown
    ## Task: [Brief task] - [Date: YYYY-MM-DD]
    - **Issue**: #[issue-number]
    - **Actions Taken**: [Bullet list of changes]
    - **Files Modified**: [Key files changed]
    - **Misses/Failures**: [What didn't work, errors encountered]
    - **Lessons Learned**: [Insights for future tasks]
    - **Time Spent**: [Approximate duration]
    ```
  - Include security considerations and performance impacts
  - Document any tech debt created or resolved

- **API Documentation Standards:**
  - Use drf-spectacular for auto-generated OpenAPI schemas
  - Document all query parameters, request/response bodies, error codes
  - Include example requests/responses for complex endpoints
  - Document rate limits, authentication requirements, pagination
  - Keep API version in URL path (`/api/v1/`)
  
- **Code Comments Best Practices:**
  - Use docstrings for all public functions/classes (Google/NumPy style for Python, JSDoc for TypeScript)
  - Comment complex algorithms, business rules, and non-obvious decisions
  - Avoid obvious comments that restate the code
  - Keep comments up-to-date with code changes (outdated comments are worse than no comments)
  - Use TODO/FIXME/NOTE tags with issue references

## 🔒 Code Quality & Security Standards

### Security Best Practices (OWASP Top 10 Compliance)

- **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - Never store passwords in plain text; use Django's built-in password hashing
  - Implement proper session management; set secure cookie flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
  - Use CSRF protection on all state-changing operations
  - Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints (use django-ratelimit)
  - Enforce strong password policies (min 12 chars, complexity requirements)
  - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin accounts

- **Data Protection:**
  - Encrypt sensitive data at rest (use Django's encrypted fields or database-level encryption)
  - Use HTTPS/TLS for all data in transit (enforce in production via middleware)
  - Implement proper tenant isolation via ForeignKey filtering (shared-schema multi-tenancy)
  - Sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS, SQL injection, command injection
  - Use parameterized queries exclusively (ORM handles this, never use raw SQL with string interpolation)
  - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

- **Secrets Management:**
  - Never commit secrets to version control (use `.env` files, exclude in `.gitignore`)
  - Use django-environ or python-decouple for environment variables
  - Rotate secrets regularly (API keys, database passwords, JWT secrets)
  - Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD credentials
  - Scan for exposed secrets using git-secrets or truffleHog
  - Use different secrets for each environment (dev/UAT/prod)

- **Dependency Security:**
  - Run `pip-audit` (Python) and `npm audit` (Node) regularly
  - Enable Dependabot for automated vulnerability alerts
  - Pin exact versions in requirements.txt and package-lock.json
  - Review security advisories before updating major dependencies
  - Remove unused dependencies monthly

- **Code Security Practices:**
  - Validate and sanitize all external inputs (API requests, file uploads, user input)
  - Use Django's built-in protections (CSRF, XSS, clickjacking, SQL injection)
  - Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
  - Use security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, HSTS)
  - Log security events (failed login attempts, permission denials)
  - Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Code Quality Standards

- **Linting & Formatting:**
  - **Python**: Black (formatting), isort (imports), flake8 (linting)
  - **TypeScript**: ESLint + Prettier
  - **Pre-commit hooks**: Enforce formatting before commit (see `.pre-commit-config.yaml`)
  - Max line length: 100 characters (Python), 120 (TypeScript)
  - Run `make format` before committing, `make lint` to check

- **Code Review Standards:**
  - All code must be reviewed by at least one other developer
  - Review checklist: correctness, security, performance, readability, tests
  - No PR should exceed 400 lines of changes (split into smaller PRs)
  - Address all review comments before merging
  - Use conventional commits for clear history

- **Static Analysis:**
  - Run type checking: `mypy` for Python (future), `tsc --noEmit` for TypeScript
  - Use Pylint/Bandit for Python security scanning
  - Use SonarQube or CodeClimate for code quality metrics
  - Maintain code quality scores above 'B' grade

- **Error Handling & Logging:**
  - Use structured logging with appropriate levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
  - Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)
  - Implement centralized error tracking (Sentry or similar)
  - Return appropriate HTTP status codes with descriptive error messages
  - Include correlation IDs for request tracing
  - Use Django's logging configuration with rotating file handlers

## ✅ Testing Strategy & Coverage

### Testing Philosophy
- **Test Pyramid**: 70% unit tests, 20% integration tests, 10% E2E tests
- **Coverage Target**: Minimum 80% overall, 90%+ for critical business logic
- **TDD Approach**: Write tests before or alongside code when possible
- **Fast Feedback**: Unit tests should run in < 1 minute

### Backend Testing (Django + DRF)

- **Test Organization:**
  ```
  backend/apps/<app>/tests/
  ├── __init__.py
  ├── test_models.py          # Model validation, business logic
  ├── test_views.py           # View layer logic
  ├── test_serializers.py     # Serialization, validation
  ├── test_api_endpoints.py   # API integration tests
  └── factories.py            # Factory Boy fixtures (future)
  ```

- **Test Types & Tools:**
  - **Unit Tests**: Django TestCase, pytest-django
  - **API Tests**: DRF's APIClient for endpoint testing
  - **Database Tests**: Use TestCase (transactions) for DB isolation
  - **Coverage**: Run `pytest --cov=apps --cov-report=html`
  - **Fixtures**: Use Factory Boy for test data generation (reduces boilerplate)

- **Testing Best Practices:**
  - Test one thing per test method (single responsibility)
  - Use descriptive test names: `test_<method>_<scenario>_<expected_result>`
  - Mock external dependencies (APIs, file system, email)
  - Test edge cases, error conditions, and boundary values
  - Test tenant isolation in multi-tenant features
  - Avoid test interdependencies (each test should be independent)

### Frontend Testing (React + TypeScript)

- **Test Organization:**
  ```
  frontend/src/components/
  ├── Button/
  │   ├── Button.tsx
  │   ├── Button.test.tsx      # Component tests
  │   └── Button.stories.tsx    # Storybook stories
  ```

- **Test Types & Tools:**
  - **Unit Tests**: React Testing Library + Jest
  - **Component Tests**: Test user interactions, not implementation details
  - **Integration Tests**: Test component integration with APIs
  - **E2E Tests**: Cypress or Playwright (future)
  - **Visual Regression**: Storybook + Chromatic (future)

- **Testing Standards:**
  - Test user-facing behavior, not internal state
  - Use accessible queries (getByRole, getByLabelText)
  - Mock API calls with MSW (Mock Service Worker)
  - Test accessibility (aria labels, keyboard navigation)
  - Maintain > 70% coverage for components

### Testing Checklist (Required for PRs)
- [ ] Unit tests for new functions/methods
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Update existing tests for modified code
- [ ] All tests pass locally: `make test`
- [ ] Coverage doesn't decrease
- [ ] Test edge cases and error scenarios
- [ ] Mock external dependencies
- [ ] Tests are independent and repeatable

## 🎯 API Design & Backend Standards (Django + DRF)

### RESTful API Design Principles

- **URL Structure:**
  - Use nouns for resources: `/api/v1/customers/`, `/api/v1/orders/`
  - Use HTTP verbs for actions: GET (read), POST (create), PUT/PATCH (update), DELETE (delete)
  - Nest related resources: `/api/v1/customers/{id}/orders/`
  - Version APIs in URL: `/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/`
  - Use plural nouns: `/customers/` not `/customer/`

- **HTTP Status Codes:**
  - 200 OK: Successful GET, PUT, PATCH
  - 201 Created: Successful POST with resource creation
  - 204 No Content: Successful DELETE
  - 400 Bad Request: Invalid input, validation errors
  - 401 Unauthorized: Missing or invalid authentication
  - 403 Forbidden: Authenticated but no permission
  - 404 Not Found: Resource doesn't exist
  - 409 Conflict: Duplicate resource or conflict
  - 500 Internal Server Error: Unexpected server error

- **Response Format:**
  ```json
  {
    "data": { ... },           // Actual response data
    "meta": {                   // Metadata
      "page": 1,
      "per_page": 20,
      "total": 100
    },
    "errors": [ ... ]           // Validation/error details
  }
  ```

- **Pagination:**
  - Use cursor-based pagination for large datasets
  - Default page size: 20-50 items
  - Include pagination metadata in response
  - Support `?page=N&page_size=M` query parameters

- **Filtering & Searching:**
  - Use query parameters: `?status=active&created_after=2024-01-01`
  - Support common filters: date ranges, status, search terms
  - Use django-filter for consistent filtering
  - Document all supported filters in API docs

### Django Best Practices

#### 🏆 MANDATORY: Declarative Migrations (Golden Standard)
**ProjectMeats maintains a Certified Golden Baseline. ALL migrations must follow these patterns:**

**🚫 ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:**
- ❌ **NEVER** use RunPython without SeparateDatabaseAndState wrapper
- ❌ **NEVER** create indexes without IF NOT EXISTS in production migrations
- ❌ **NEVER** create merge migrations (rename and linearize instead)
- ❌ **NEVER** commit migrations that fail `makemigrations --check`
- ❌ **NEVER** use raw SQL without state synchronization

**✅ REQUIRED PATTERNS (MANDATORY):**

**1. State Synchronization for Custom SQL:**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: When using custom SQL, wrap with SeparateDatabaseAndState
migrations.SeparateDatabaseAndState(
    state_operations=[
        # Tell Django's state what changed
        migrations.AddField(model_name="mymodel", name="myfield", ...)
    ],
    database_operations=[
        # Actual SQL or NO-OP if already exists
        migrations.RunSQL("ALTER TABLE ...")
    ]
)

# ❌ WRONG: Raw RunPython without state wrapper
migrations.RunPython(my_function)  # Django can't introspect this!
```

**2. Idempotent Schema Operations:**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Production-grade index creation
migrations.SeparateDatabaseAndState(
    state_operations=[
        migrations.AddIndex(model_name="mymodel", index=...)
    ],
    database_operations=[
        migrations.RunSQL(
            sql="CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_name ON table (fields);",
            reverse_sql="DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_name;"
        )
    ]
)

# ❌ WRONG: Not idempotent
migrations.AddIndex(...)  # Fails if index exists!
```

**3. Migration Linearization:**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: When conflicts arise, rename and resequence
# 0005_conflicting.py → 0006_feature.py
# Update dependencies to point to 0005_baseline

# ❌ WRONG: Creating merge migrations
# python manage.py makemigrations --merge  # Creates complex graphs
```

**4. Validation Gate (CI/CD):**
```bash
# ✅ MUST PASS: Before every commit
python manage.py makemigrations --check
# Output: "No changes detected" ✅

# ✅ MUST PASS: Before deployment
python manage.py migrate --fake-initial --noinput
```

**🔍 VERIFICATION TEST:**
If migrations fail with ANY of these errors, you VIOLATED the golden standard:
- "Conflicting migrations detected" → Linearize, don't merge
- "DuplicateTable" → Use IF NOT EXISTS
- "Changes detected" → Used RunPython without state sync
- "Migration cannot be applied" → Schema drift from manual SQL

**Why This Matters**: Phase 2 Golden State Achievement (Jan 4, 2026) established a Certified Golden Baseline with 71 migrations and "No changes detected" status. Any deviation causes "perception drift" and breaks the Single Source of Truth.

**Authority**: See `docs/GOLDEN_STANDARD_ACHIEVEMENT.md` - Phase 2 section


- **Models:**
  - Use explicit field names (avoid abbreviations)
  - Add `verbose_name` and `help_text` for admin interface
  - Implement `__str__` method for readable representations
  - Use `Meta.ordering` for consistent default ordering
  - Add database indexes on frequently queried fields
  - Use `unique=True` or `unique_together` for data integrity
  - Implement model validation in `clean()` method

- **QuerySet Optimization:**
  - Use `select_related()` for foreign keys (SQL JOIN)
  - Use `prefetch_related()` for reverse foreign keys and M2M
  - Use `only()` or `defer()` to limit fetched fields
  - Avoid N+1 queries (use Django Debug Toolbar to detect)
  - Use `annotate()` and `aggregate()` for complex queries
  - Cache expensive queries with Django's cache framework

- **Serializers:**
  - Use `ModelSerializer` for model-based serializers
  - Implement field-level validation: `validate_<field_name>()`
  - Implement object-level validation: `validate()`
  - Use nested serializers for related objects
  - Use `read_only_fields` for computed/auto-generated fields
  - Document all fields in docstrings

- **ViewSets & Permissions:**
  - Use `ModelViewSet` for standard CRUD operations
  - Implement custom actions with `@action` decorator
  - Use DRF permissions: IsAuthenticated, IsAdminUser, custom permissions
  - Implement tenant-based permissions for multi-tenancy
  - Override `get_queryset()` to filter by tenant
  - Use throttling for rate limiting

- **Migrations:**
  - Always run `makemigrations` before committing model changes
  - Review migration files before committing
  - Test migrations in development before UAT/production
  - Use `RunPython` for data migrations
  - Never edit applied migrations (create new ones)
  - Document complex migrations with comments
  - Test rollback procedures for critical migrations

### 🏢 Shared-Schema Multi-Tenancy Patterns

**CRITICAL**: ProjectMeats uses SHARED-SCHEMA multi-tenancy. NO django-tenants schema isolation.

#### Core Principles

1. **Single PostgreSQL Schema**
   - All tenants share the `public` PostgreSQL schema
   - Business models have `tenant` ForeignKey for data isolation
   - Standard Django `migrate` command (NO `migrate_schemas`)

2. **Standard Migration Commands**
   ```bash
   # Create migrations
   python manage.py makemigrations
   
   # Apply migrations
   python manage.py migrate
   
   # Check for unapplied migrations (CI gating)
   python manage.py makemigrations --check
   ```

3. **Tenant-Aware Query Patterns**
   ```python
   # ✅ CORRECT: Filter by current tenant
   def get_queryset(self):
       return super().get_queryset().filter(tenant=self.request.tenant)
   
   # ❌ WRONG: Exposes all tenants' data
   def get_queryset(self):
       return super().get_queryset()
   ```

4. **Tenant Isolation in ViewSets**
   ```python
   from rest_framework import viewsets
   
   class CustomerViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
       serializer_class = CustomerSerializer
       permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]
       
       def get_queryset(self):
           # ALWAYS filter by tenant
           return Customer.objects.filter(tenant=self.request.tenant)
       
       def perform_create(self, serializer):
           # ALWAYS set tenant on creation
           serializer.save(tenant=self.request.tenant)
   ```

#### Common Pitfalls

❌ **NEVER do this**:
```python
# Exposes all tenants' data
Customer.objects.all()

# Bypasses tenant isolation
Customer.objects.filter(name='ABC Corp')

# Forgets to set tenant on create
customer = Customer.objects.create(name='ABC Corp')
```

✅ **ALWAYS do this**:
```python
# Properly isolated
Customer.objects.filter(tenant=request.tenant)

# Safe create
customer = Customer.objects.create(name='ABC Corp', tenant=request.tenant)

# Safe update
customer = Customer.objects.filter(tenant=request.tenant, id=customer_id).first()
if customer:
    customer.name = 'Updated'
    customer.save()
```

#### Migration Best Practices

1. **Use --fake-initial for Idempotency (Production)**
   - Prevents duplicate migration errors
   - Safe to re-run in CI/CD pipelines
   - Assumes initial migrations already exist

2. **Test Migrations Locally First**
   ```bash
   # Standard migration commands
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   
   # Verify
   python manage.py showmigrations
   ```

#### Tenant Middleware Considerations

1. **Health Check Endpoints**
   - Must bypass tenant middleware
   - Use @csrf_exempt decorator
   - Return simple 200 response
   
   ```python
   # backend/projectmeats/urls.py
   from django.http import JsonResponse
   from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt
   
   @csrf_exempt
   def health_check_view(request):
       return JsonResponse({'status': 'healthy'}, status=200)
   
   urlpatterns = [
       path('api/v1/health/', health_check_view, name='health-check'),
       # ... other patterns
   ]
   ```

2. **Admin Interface**
   - Admin must handle multi-tenant data carefully
   - Filter ModelAdmin querysets by tenant if applicable
   - Superusers can see all tenants

#### CI/CD Integration

1. **GitHub Actions Workflows**
   - Use standard `migrate` command
   - Add `makemigrations --check` gating
   - Environment-scoped DB URLs (DEV_DB_URL, UAT_DB_URL, PROD_DB_URL)
   
2. **Devcontainer Setup**
   - postCreateCommand runs standard migrations
   - Sets up test data
   - Ready for immediate development

#### Debugging Multi-Tenancy Issues

**Symptom**: "Tenant not found" or "ALLOWED_HOSTS" error
- **Cause**: Tenant middleware intercepting health check
- **Fix**: Ensure health endpoint bypasses tenant middleware

**Symptom**: User sees data from other tenants
- **Cause**: Missing tenant filter in queryset
- **Fix**: Always filter by `tenant=request.tenant`

**Symptom**: Migration fails with "table already exists"
- **Cause**: Not using --fake-initial
- **Fix**: Use `python manage.py migrate --fake-initial`

**Symptom**: Tests fail with "no such table"
- **Cause**: Test database not migrated
- **Fix**: Run migrations in test setup

## ⚛️ Frontend Standards (React + TypeScript)

### Component Architecture

- **Component Organization:**
  ```
  src/components/
  ├── common/              # Reusable UI components (Button, Input, Modal)
  ├── layout/              # Layout components (Header, Footer, Sidebar)
  ├── features/            # Feature-specific components
  └── screens/             # Page-level components
  ```

- **Component Best Practices:**
  - Use functional components with hooks (no class components)
  - Keep components small and focused (< 300 lines)
  - Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
  - Use TypeScript interfaces for props
  - Implement proper prop validation
  - Use React.memo() for expensive components
  - Avoid inline function definitions in render

- **State Management:**
  - Use React Context for global state (auth, theme)
  - Use local state (useState) for component-specific state
  - Consider Redux/Zustand for complex state (future)
  - Lift state to common ancestor when sharing between components
  - Use useReducer for complex state logic
  - Avoid prop drilling (use context or composition)

- **Hooks Best Practices:**
  - Follow Rules of Hooks (only call at top level, only in React functions)
  - Use `useEffect` for side effects (API calls, subscriptions)
  - Clean up effects with return function
  - Use `useMemo` for expensive computations
  - Use `useCallback` to memoize functions passed as props
  - Create custom hooks for reusable logic (prefix with `use`)

### TypeScript Best Practices

- **Type Safety:**
  - Avoid `any` type (use `unknown` if type is truly unknown)
  - Define interfaces for all props, state, API responses
  - Use union types for explicit state values
  - Use enums for fixed sets of values
  - Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json
  - Use type guards for runtime type checking

- **Type Organization:**
  ```
  src/types/
  ├── api.ts               # API request/response types
  ├── models.ts            # Domain model types
  └── components.ts        # Component prop types
  ```

### Styling Best Practices

- **Styled Components:**
  - Use styled-components for component-level styles
  - Create reusable styled components in `src/styles/`
  - Use theme for consistent colors, spacing, typography
  - Avoid inline styles (use styled components)
  - Use CSS variables for dynamic values
  - Support dark mode via theme switching

- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Use React.lazy() and Suspense for code splitting
  - Implement virtualization for long lists (react-window)
  - Optimize images (use WebP, lazy loading)
  - Minimize bundle size (analyze with webpack-bundle-analyzer)
  - Use production builds for deployment
  - Implement service workers for PWA (future)

- **Ant Design Usage:**
  - Use Ant Design components consistently
  - Customize theme via ConfigProvider
  - Follow Ant Design best practices and patterns
  - Don't mix UI libraries (stick to Ant Design)

---

## ⚡ Performance Optimization

### Backend Performance

- **Database Optimization:**
  - Add indexes on frequently queried fields (foreign keys, search fields)
  - Use database-level constraints for data integrity
  - Implement database connection pooling
  - Use read replicas for read-heavy workloads (future)
  - Monitor slow queries with Django Debug Toolbar
  - Optimize query performance with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`

- **Caching Strategy:**
  - Cache expensive computations and queries

## ♿ Accessibility & Internationalization

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance)

- **Semantic HTML:**
  - Use proper HTML elements (button, nav, main, header, footer)
  - Use heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3) correctly
  - Use landmark roles (role="navigation", role="main")
  - Avoid div/span soup

- **Keyboard Navigation:**
  - All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
  - Implement logical tab order (tabIndex)

  - Provide alt text for all images
  - Use aria-hidden for decorative elements

- **Visual Accessibility:**
  - Maintain color contrast ratio > 4.5:1 for normal text, > 3:1 for large text
  - Don't rely on color alone to convey information
  - Support text resizing up to 200%
  - Avoid flashing content (seizure risk)
  - Use relative units (rem, em) instead of px

- **Forms & Validation:**
  - Associate labels with inputs (for attribute)
  - Provide clear error messages
  - Use aria-invalid and aria-describedby for errors
  - Support autocomplete attributes
  - Group related inputs with fieldset/legend

### Internationalization (i18n)

- **Backend (Django):**
  - Use Django's translation framework (gettext)
  - Mark all user-facing strings for translation
  - Use locale middleware for language detection
  - Support multiple timezones
  - Format dates, numbers, currency by locale

- **Frontend (React):**
  - Use react-i18next or react-intl
  - Extract all user-facing strings
  - Support RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew)
  - Implement language switcher
  - Load translations dynamically

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use ICU message format for pluralization
  - Avoid string concatenation (use placeholders)
  - Test all languages in UI
  - Provide fallback to English
  - Consider cultural differences in icons, colors

---

- **Regular Clean-Up:**  
  - Remove unused deps, dead code, deprecated configs/scripts
  - Archive inactive branches/tags (> 3 months old unless needed)
  - Format/lint all code before merge (Black for Python, Prettier for JS/TS)

- **Refactoring:**  
  - Modularize/reduce tech debt, maintain/test coverage
  - No breaking API/model changes without migration plan/docs/review
  - Remove feature flags once stable

- **Maintenance:**  
  - Audit permissions, branches, tags, dependencies monthly
  - Remove/Archive obsolete Terraform/HCL/infra unless strictly needed
  - Sync CI/CD pipeline configs to current branch/env structure

---

## ⚡ Requirements & Dependency Management

### Python/Django Backend

- **Dependency Files:**
  - `backend/requirements.txt`: All dependencies with pinned versions
  - `pyproject.toml`: Project metadata and optional dependencies
  - Use pip-tools for dependency management: `pip-compile requirements.in`

- **Dependency Best Practices:**
  - Pin exact versions for production: `Django==4.2.7` (not `Django>=4.2`)
  - Use version ranges for development only
  - Document why each dependency is needed
  - Run `pip-audit` monthly for security vulnerabilities
  - Review Dependabot alerts within 1 week
  - Test dependency updates in development first
  - Update dependencies quarterly (minor versions monthly)

- **Security Scanning:**
  - Run `pip-audit` before releases
  - Enable GitHub Dependabot alerts
  - Use Safety or Snyk for continuous monitoring
  - Review CVEs for critical dependencies
  - Have rollback plan for failed updates

### TypeScript/Node Frontend

- **Dependency Files:**
  - `frontend/package.json`: All dependencies
  - `frontend/package-lock.json`: Locked versions (never delete!)
  - Separate dependencies from devDependencies

- **Dependency Best Practices:**
  - Use exact versions in package.json for production deps
  - Use `^` for devDependencies to allow minor updates
  - Run `npm audit` or `yarn audit` monthly
  - Remove unused packages: `npm prune` or `npx depcheck`
  - Keep React and TypeScript up-to-date (quarterly)
  - Use `npm ci` in CI/CD (faster, uses lock file)

- **Bundle Size Management:**
  - Monitor bundle size with webpack-bundle-analyzer
  - Avoid large dependencies (moment.js → date-fns, lodash → individual imports)
  - Use tree shaking to eliminate dead code
  - Keep total bundle < 500KB gzipped
  - Alert on > 10% bundle size increase

### Mobile Dependencies (React Native)

- **Dependency Management:**
  - Keep React Native version synchronized with React
  - Test native modules thoroughly before upgrading
  - Use patch-package for critical third-party fixes
  - Document native dependency requirements
  - Test on both iOS and Android after updates

### Shared Dependencies

- Synchronize TypeScript versions across frontend/mobile
- Share utility packages via `/shared` directory
- Document breaking changes in shared utilities
- Version shared code semantically

### Dependency Update Strategy

1. **Monthly**: Check for security updates, apply critical patches
2. **Quarterly**: Update minor versions, test thoroughly
3. **Annually**: Review all dependencies, remove unused, update major versions
4. **Immediately**: Apply security patches for critical vulnerabilities

---

## 🔄 CI/CD & Deployment Best Practices

### Continuous Integration

- **Automated Checks (Run on every PR):**
  - Linting: Python (flake8), TypeScript (eslint)
  - Formatting: Black, Prettier
  - Type checking: mypy (future), tsc
  - Unit tests: Backend (pytest), Frontend (Jest)
  - Security scans: pip-audit, npm audit
  - Code coverage: pytest-cov (min 80%)
  - Build validation: Docker builds, frontend production build

- **PR Requirements:**
  - All CI checks must pass (no exceptions)
  - At least 1 code review approval
  - No merge conflicts
  - Branch naming validation
  - PR title follows conventional commits
  - Tests cover new code
  - Documentation updated

### Deployment Workflow

> **CRITICAL**: Environment promotion PRs (development → UAT → production) are managed **exclusively** by automated workflows (`.github/workflows/promote-dev-to-uat.yml` and `.github/workflows/promote-uat-to-main.yml`). These workflows automatically close stale PRs and create fresh ones with the latest commits. 

**Deployment Protection Rules:**
- ❌ **NEVER** push changes directly to `uat` or `main` branches
- ❌ **NEVER** create manual PRs for environment promotion
- ❌ **NEVER** bypass the automated promotion workflows
- ✅ **ALWAYS** start with feature/fix branch from `development`
- ✅ **ALWAYS** let automated workflows handle promotion PRs
- ✅ **ALWAYS** wait for UAT testing before promoting to production

**Correct Workflow:**
1. Create feature/fix branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature development`
2. Develop and test locally
3. Push branch: `git push origin feature/my-feature`
4. Create PR to `development` via GitHub UI
5. After review and merge, `promote-dev-to-uat.yml` automatically creates PR to `UAT`
6. Test in UAT environment, then merge PR
7. After UAT merge, `promote-uat-to-main.yml` automatically creates PR to `main`
8. Final review and merge to deploy to production

- **Environment Progression:**
  ```
  feature/fix branch → development → UAT → main (production)
  ```
  - Development: Auto-deploy on merge to `development`
  - UAT: Auto-deploy on merge to `UAT` (requires approval and testing)
  - Production: Auto-deploy on merge to `main` (requires 2 approvals)

- **Deployment Gates:**
  - All tests pass in source environment
  - Code review approved
  - Security scans clean
  - Performance benchmarks met
  - Database migrations tested
  - Rollback plan documented

- **Deployment Checklist:**
  - [ ] Database migrations tested in staging
  - [ ] Environment variables updated
  - [ ] Feature flags configured
  - [ ] Monitoring/alerting configured
  - [ ] Rollback procedure documented
  - [ ] Health checks passing
  - [ ] Performance metrics baseline
  - [ ] Security scan passed

### Infrastructure as Code

- **Archived Infrastructure:**
  - Terraform and Docker configs archived in `/archived`
  - Current deployment uses DigitalOcean App Platform
  - Infrastructure changes require review

- **Configuration Management:**
  - Use `config/manage_env.py` for environment setup
  - Store secrets in GitHub Secrets, not in code
  - Use `.env.example` files as templates
  - Document all required environment variables
  - Validate environment configuration before deployment

### Monitoring & Observability

- **Application Monitoring:**
  - Implement health check endpoints (`/health`, `/ready`)
  - Monitor API response times and error rates
  - Track database query performance
  - Monitor memory usage and CPU
  - Set up alerts for critical failures

- **Logging Best Practices:**
  - Use structured logging (JSON format in production)
  - Include correlation IDs for request tracing
  - Log levels: DEBUG (dev only), INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
  - Don't log sensitive data (PII, passwords, tokens)
  - Centralize logs (CloudWatch, Datadog, Splunk)
  - Set up log retention policies

- **Alerting:**
  - Error rate > 5% → Page on-call
  - Response time > 2s → Warning
  - Database connection failures → Critical alert
  - Security events → Immediate notification
  - Deploy failures → Team notification

### Rollback Procedures

- **Database Rollbacks:**
  - Test migration rollbacks before production
  - Use reversible migrations (avoid data loss)
  - Backup database before major migrations
  - Document rollback steps in migration

- **Application Rollbacks:**
  - Use container tags for easy rollback
  - Keep previous 3 versions deployed
  - Document rollback procedure in deployment docs
  - Test rollback in UAT environment
  - Monitor closely after rollback

## ⚙️ Coding Guidelines & Component Update Checklists

### General Development Principles

- Always update relevant files for component changes (models, admin, serializers, forms, templates, docs, tests)
- Test locally and in UAT before production
- Use descriptive commits referencing issues/PRs following Conventional Commits
- Keep PRs focused and small (< 400 lines of changes)
- Review your own PR before requesting review
- Address all review comments or explain why not

### Django/Backend Development

- **Migrations:**
  - Use Django model best practices (explicit field names, help_text, verbose_name)
  - **CRITICAL:** Never modify applied migrations once they are applied
  - **CRITICAL:** For **any** model change in the project:
    - Run `python manage.py makemigrations` AND commit the migration file
    - Use standard `python manage.py migrate` for applying migrations
    - For production, use `python manage.py migrate --fake-initial --noinput` for idempotency
    - All apps use shared-schema multi-tenancy (no separate tenant schemas)
  - Always run `python manage.py makemigrations --check` before committing
  - Test migrations on fresh database locally before PR
  - Use minimal dependencies (only depend on migrations you actually need)
  - CharField with `blank=True` MUST have `default=''` for PostgreSQL
  - Always commit migration files with model changes
  - Update admin.py/serializers/tests/docs for new fields
  - Add database indexes on frequently queried fields
  - Implement model validation in `clean()` method
  - Test migration rollback procedures (`migrate <app> <previous_migration>`)
  - Document complex migrations with docstrings explaining "why"

- **API Development:**
  - Follow RESTful conventions
  - Use ModelSerializer for consistency
  - Implement proper error handling and validation
  - Add comprehensive API documentation
  - Test all endpoints with APIClient
  - Implement tenant isolation for multi-tenant features

### Frontend/TypeScript Development

- **Component Development:**
  - Use functional components with hooks

## 📊 Copilot Agent Efficiency & Lessons Learned

### Overview
This section consolidates key lessons from 50+ PR deployments (documented in [copilot-log.md](../copilot-log.md)) to improve Copilot agent efficiency and prevent recurring issues.

### Critical Migration Lessons (Most Common Issues)

**Issue Frequency:** 8+ tasks in copilot-log related to migration problems

1. **Never Modify Applied Migrations**
   - ❌ Changing dependencies after migration is applied
   - ✅ Create new migration to fix issues

2. **Minimal Migration Dependencies**
   - ❌ Depending on unnecessary later migrations
   - ✅ Only depend on migrations that create models/fields you reference
   - Rule: ForeignKey only needs the migration that creates the target model

3. **PostgreSQL CharField Defaults**
   - ❌ `CharField(blank=True)` without `default=''`
   - ✅ `CharField(blank=True, default='')` always
   - Why: PostgreSQL distinguishes between empty string and NULL

4. **Test Migrations on Fresh Database**
   - Before every PR, test: `dropdb test_db && createdb test_db && python manage.py migrate`
   - Prevents: InconsistentMigrationHistory errors in production

### Deployment & Configuration Lessons

**Issue Frequency:** 5+ tasks related to deployment configuration

1. **CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS Must Match CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS**
   - Common error: Admin 403 errors from cross-domain requests
   - Solution: Keep CSRF and CORS configurations synchronized
   - Both should include all frontend and backend domains

2. **Static Files Need Persistent Volume Mounts**
   - Issue: Admin CSS/JS 404 errors
   - Cause: `collectstatic` ran in temporary container without volume
   - Solution: Always mount staticfiles volume for both collectstatic and app container
   - Required permissions: `chown -R 1000:1000 /path/to/staticfiles`

3. **Database Backups Before Migrations**
   - Always backup before applying migrations
   - Automated in deployment workflows via `.github/scripts/backup-database.sh`
   - Keeps last 7 backups automatically

4. **Environment Variable Validation**
   - Use `.github/scripts/validate-environment.sh` to check required vars
   - Validates: SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL, CORS/CSRF config, security settings
   - Warns about misconfigurations before deployment

### Multi-Tenancy Lessons

**Issue Frequency:** 4+ tasks related to tenant isolation

1. **TenantFilteredAdmin for All Tenant Models**
   - All admin classes for models with `tenant` field must extend `TenantFilteredAdmin`
   - Ensures non-superuser staff only see their tenant's data
   - Pattern: `class MyAdmin(TenantFilteredAdmin)` instead of `admin.ModelAdmin`

2. **Tenant-Aware ViewSets**
   - Override `get_queryset()` to filter by tenant
   - Fall back to user's first tenant if needed
   - Pattern:
     ```python
     def get_queryset(self):
         user = self.request.user
         tenant = getattr(user, 'tenant', None) or user.tenantuser_set.first()?.tenant
         return super().get_queryset().filter(tenant=tenant)
     ```

3. **Automatic Tenant Assignment**
   - Use signals or override `perform_create()` to auto-assign tenant
   - Never require frontend to send tenant ID

### Testing & Validation Lessons

**Issue Frequency:** 6+ tasks improved by better testing

1. **Pre-commit Hooks Prevent Common Issues**
   - Syntax validation for migration files
   - Checking for unapplied migrations
   - Black/isort/flake8 formatting
   - Install: `pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install`

2. **Migration Validation in CI/CD**
   - All workflows now include `.github/scripts/validate-migrations.sh`
   - Validates: syntax, dependencies, conflicts, fresh database test
   - Prevents migration issues from reaching deployment

3. **Error Handling Patterns**
   - Always use try/except in ViewSets with proper error logging
   - Return descriptive error messages (not just 500)
   - Pattern:
     ```python
     try:
         # operation
     except Exception as e:
         logger.error(f"Error in {self.__class__.__name__}: {str(e)}")
         return Response({"error": str(e)}, status=500)
     ```

### Code Organization Lessons

**Issue Frequency:** 3+ tasks could be prevented by base classes

1. **Create Base Classes for Common Patterns**
   - Suggested: `TenantAwareViewSet` with built-in tenant filtering
   - Suggested: `BaseSerializer` with common validation patterns
   - Benefit: DRY principle, consistent behavior across codebase

2. **Custom Exception Handlers**
   - Create DRF custom exception handler for consistent error responses
   - Centralize error logging
   - Benefit: Better error tracking, consistent API responses

### Security Lessons

**Issue Frequency:** 3+ tasks related to security configuration

1. **Never Log Sensitive Data**
   - No passwords, tokens, PII in logs
   - Use `[REDACTED]` placeholders
   - Filter sensitive fields in error reports

2. **Production Security Checklist**
   - DEBUG = False
   - SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
   - CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
   - ALLOWED_HOSTS properly configured
   - Secrets in environment variables (never in code)

3. **Tenant Isolation in Queries**
   - Always filter by tenant at database level (not just UI)
   - Use `TenantFilteredAdmin` and tenant-aware querysets
   - Test with non-superuser accounts

### Performance Lessons

**Issue Frequency:** 2+ tasks related to performance

1. **Use select_related() and prefetch_related()**
   - Avoid N+1 queries in list views
   - Pattern: `queryset.select_related('tenant', 'user').prefetch_related('items')`
   - Use Django Debug Toolbar to detect N+1 queries

2. **Minimize Bundle Size**
   - Frontend bundles should be < 500KB gzipped
   - Use code splitting with `React.lazy()`
   - Avoid large dependencies (moment.js → date-fns)

### Automation Improvements Implemented

Based on recurring issues, we've added:

1. **Migration Validation Script** (`.github/scripts/validate-migrations.sh`)
   - Checks syntax, dependencies, conflicts
   - Tests on fresh database in CI
   - Prevents 90% of migration-related deployment failures

2. **Environment Validation Script** (`.github/scripts/validate-environment.sh`)
   - Validates required environment variables
   - Checks CORS/CSRF consistency
   - Warns about insecure configurations

3. **Database Backup Script** (`.github/scripts/backup-database.sh`)
   - Automatic backups before migrations
   - Keeps last 7 backups
   - Compresses to save space

4. **Enhanced Pre-commit Hooks** (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)
   - Migration syntax validation
   - Unapplied migration detection
   - Python formatting and linting

5. **Migration Validation in CI/CD**
   - All deployment workflows include migration validation
   - Runs on every PR before deployment
   - Fails fast to prevent deployment issues

### Efficiency Metrics

**Before Improvements:**
- Migration-related deployment failures: ~30% of deployments
- Average time to diagnose issues: 2-3 hours
- Repeated issues: Same patterns in 5+ tasks

**After Improvements:**
- Migration-related deployment failures: Target < 5%
- Average time to diagnose: < 30 minutes (with troubleshooting guide)
- Repeated issues: Prevented by automation

### Quick Reference: Common Copilot Agent Tasks

**Before Creating PR:**
- [ ] Run `.github/scripts/validate-migrations.sh` (if backend changes)
- [ ] Run `.github/scripts/validate-environment.sh` (if config changes)
- [ ] Test migrations on fresh database
- [ ] Ensure pre-commit hooks pass
- [ ] Review architecture decisions in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- [ ] Update copilot-log.md with lessons learned

**For Migration Changes:**
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Before creating a PR, always run `python manage.py makemigrations` locally. If new files are generated, they MUST be committed. The CI pipeline will now fail any PR that has unapplied migrations, detected via the new pre-commit hook.**
- [ ] Never modify applied migrations
- [ ] Use minimal dependencies
- [ ] Add `default=''` to CharField with `blank=True`
- [ ] Test rollback: `python manage.py migrate <app> <previous>`
- [ ] Document complex migrations with docstrings
- [ ] Verify migration plan: `python manage.py migrate --plan`

**For Deployment Issues:**
- [ ] If the deployment fails with "Unapplied migrations detected", the developer MUST run `git pull`, execute `python manage.py makemigrations`, commit the new file(s), and push to re-trigger the pipeline
- [ ] Check copilot-log.md for similar issues and solutions
- [ ] Review GitHub Actions logs
- [ ] SSH to server and check container logs
- [ ] Compare working vs broken environment variables
- [ ] Follow rollback procedure if needed

**For Admin Changes:**
- [ ] Extend `TenantFilteredAdmin` for tenant models
- [ ] Test with non-superuser account
- [ ] Verify superuser still sees all data
- [ ] Check CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS includes admin domain

## Django Migration Best Practices

### Standard Migration Commands

**ProjectMeats uses STANDARD Django migrations (NO django-tenants migrate_schemas).**

```bash
# Create migrations
python manage.py makemigrations

# Apply migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Check for unapplied migrations (CI gating)
python manage.py makemigrations --check

# Show migration status
python manage.py showmigrations
```

### Idempotent Migrations with `--fake-initial`

**When to Use:** Production deployments, redeployments, or when tables may already exist.

**Command:**
```bash
python manage.py migrate --fake-initial --noinput
```

**What It Does:**
- Checks if tables from initial migrations already exist
- If they exist, marks those migrations as applied without running them
- Continues with unapplied migrations normally
- Prevents "relation already exists" errors on redeployment

**When NOT to Use:**
- Fresh database setup (not harmful, but unnecessary)
- Development environments where you want to catch schema drift
- When you need to verify initial migrations actually run

**Example Use Case:**
Deploying to a server where manual table creation occurred, or redeploying after a rollback:

```bash
# This will NOT fail even if users table exists
python manage.py migrate --fake-initial

# Output:
# Operations to perform:
#   Apply all migrations: auth, contenttypes, sessions, ...
# Running migrations:
#   Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... FAKED
#   Applying auth.0001_initial... FAKED
#   Applying myapp.0002_new_feature... OK
```

**Safety Guarantees:**
- ✅ Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- ✅ Won't skip actual schema changes
- ✅ Only affects initial migrations (0001_initial.py)
- ⚠️ Assumes initial schema is correct (doesn't verify)

**CI/CD Integration:**
Our deployment workflows use `--fake-initial` to ensure reliable redeployments without manual intervention.

**References:**
- Django Docs: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/django-admin/#cmdoption-migrate-fake-initial
- Our Implementation: `.github/workflows/11-dev-deployment.yml` (deploy-backend job)

## 🔐 Secret Management

### SOURCE OF TRUTH: `config/env.manifest.json`

**All environment variables and GitHub secret mappings are defined in the Environment Manifest.**

### Critical Rules

#### 1. Strict Adherence
- ✅ **ALWAYS** read `config/env.manifest.json` for secret names
- ❌ **NEVER** guess or infer secret names from patterns
- ❌ **NEVER** assume naming conventions are consistent
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use exact `ci_secret_mapping` values in workflows

#### 2. Legacy Naming Patterns
ProjectMeats has **inconsistent naming** by design:
- `SSH_PASSWORD` is **shared** between UAT and Production
- `DEV_SSH_PASSWORD` is **unique** to Development
- Frontend variables use **same name** across environments with different values

**This is intentional and documented in the manifest.**

#### 3. Secret Mapping Types

**Explicit Mapping** (Preferred):
```json
"BASTION_HOST": {
  "ci_secret_mapping": {
    "dev-backend": "DEV_HOST",
    "uat2-backend": "UAT_HOST",
    "prod2-backend": "PROD_HOST"
  }
}
```

**Pattern-Based**:
```json
"SECRET_KEY": {
  "ci_secret_pattern": "{PREFIX}_SECRET_KEY"
}
```
Expands to: `DEV_SECRET_KEY`, `UAT_SECRET_KEY`, `PROD_SECRET_KEY`

**Computed Values**:
```json
"DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE": {
  "value_source": "environment_config"
}
```
Derived from manifest's environment configuration.

### Audit Command

**Run before and after secret changes:**

```bash
python config/manage_env.py audit
```

**Output:**
- 🧟 **Zombie Secrets**: In GitHub, NOT in manifest (should be removed or documented)
- ❌ **Missing Secrets**: In manifest, NOT in GitHub (must be added)
- ✅ **Audit Passed**: All secrets are in sync

### Workflow Integration

**❌ WRONG: Guessing Names**
```yaml
env:
  SSH_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.UAT_SSH_PASSWORD }}  # Does not exist!
```

**✅ CORRECT: Using Manifest**
```yaml
# For UAT/Prod (shared secret)
env:
  SSH_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.SSH_PASSWORD }}

# For Dev (unique secret)
env:
  SSH_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DEV_SSH_PASSWORD }}
```

### Adding New Secrets

1. **Update Manifest First**
   ```bash
   vim config/env.manifest.json
   # Add to appropriate category with mapping
   ```

2. **Choose Mapping Type**
   - Explicit mapping for inconsistent names
   - Pattern-based for consistent naming
   - Computed for derived values

3. **Add to GitHub**
   ```bash
   gh secret set SECRET_NAME --body "value"
   ```

4. **Verify with Audit**
   ```bash
   python config/manage_env.py audit
   ```

### AI Context

For detailed secret handling rules, see:
- **`.github/ai-context/env-handling.md`** - Comprehensive guide for AI and developers
- **`config/env.manifest.json`** - Single source of truth for all mappings

### Troubleshooting

**"Secret not found" in workflow:**
1. Check manifest for environment (e.g., `uat2-backend`)
2. Find variable (e.g., `BASTION_HOST`)
3. Use exact name from `ci_secret_mapping` (e.g., `UAT_HOST`)

**"Zombie secrets" in audit:**
- Legacy secrets no longer in use
- Add to manifest if still needed, or delete from GitHub

**"Missing secrets" in audit:**
- Required by manifest but not in GitHub
- Add immediately to prevent deployment failures

## 🏆 GOLDEN PIPELINE RULES (ENFORCEMENT)

**Authority**: [`docs/GOLDEN_PIPELINE.md`](../docs/GOLDEN_PIPELINE.md) is the definitive reference for all deployment practices.

### Absolute Prohibitions for CI/CD

#### Database Migrations
❌ **NEVER** suggest SSH-based migrations from deployed containers  
❌ **NEVER** run migrations as part of web server startup  
❌ **NEVER** use direct database access from GitHub runners  
❌ **NEVER** skip the bastion tunnel pattern  
❌ **NEVER** omit --network host for migration containers  

#### Health Checks
❌ **NEVER** check frontend via reverse proxy (port 80)  
❌ **NEVER** use more than 5 retry attempts  
❌ **NEVER** omit the Host header when checking proxies  

#### Image Tags
❌ **NEVER** use :latest tag in production deployments  
❌ **NEVER** skip SHA tagging for images  
❌ **NEVER** deploy without immutable image tags  

### Required Practices for CI/CD

#### Database Migrations (Runner-Based)
✅ **ALWAYS** use bastion tunnel pattern (SSH -L 5433)  
✅ **ALWAYS** run migrations via Docker with --network host  
✅ **ALWAYS** construct DATABASE_URL pointing to 127.0.0.1:5433  
✅ **ALWAYS** cleanup tunnel after migration  
✅ **ALWAYS** use migrate --fake-initial --noinput  

#### Health Checks
✅ **ALWAYS** check backend on localhost:8000/api/v1/health/  
✅ **ALWAYS** check frontend on 127.0.0.1:8080/ (container direct)  
✅ **ALWAYS** use exactly 5 retry attempts  
✅ **ALWAYS** verify proxy status separately (non-blocking)  

#### Image Management
✅ **ALWAYS** tag images with {env}-{sha} format  
✅ **ALWAYS** push to both DOCR and GHCR  
✅ **ALWAYS** pull specific SHA tag for deployments  
✅ **ALWAYS** use immutable references  

### Verification Commands

Before suggesting any deployment changes:

```bash
# 1. Verify manifest is authoritative
cat config/env.manifest.json | jq '.version'

# 2. Run secret audit
python config/manage_env.py audit

# 3. Check workflow has golden patterns
grep "ssh -L 5433" .github/workflows/reusable-deploy.yml
grep "127.0.0.1:8080" .github/workflows/reusable-deploy.yml

# 4. Verify golden state
bash scripts/verify_golden_state.sh
```

### Documentation Hierarchy

When answering deployment questions:

1. **PRIMARY**: docs/GOLDEN_PIPELINE.md
2. **Secrets**: docs/CONFIGURATION_AND_SECRETS.md
3. **Workflow**: .github/workflows/reusable-deploy.yml
4. **Config**: config/env.manifest.json
5. **UI/UX**: docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md (single source of truth)
