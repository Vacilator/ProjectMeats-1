- 2026-03-13 — Phase 7 Stabilization + Cockpit Navigation — Commit: 6144c189 (PR: #3447)
  - PR: https://github.com/Meats-Central/ProjectMeats/pull/3447
  - Cockpit: navigation-path driven continuous browsing + breadcrumb jumping; UUID-safe relationships endpoint.
  - Backend: relationship discovery returns contacts/recent orders/related products; RLS middleware sets+resets both `app.current_tenant` + `app.current_tenant_id`.
  - Workflows: migrations/models aligned for tenant/RLS stability (MyTasks/workflow executions).
  - FlowEditor: entity-first Form config, Smart Auto-Map suggestions, removed raw JSON editor, deprecated multi-step container edit path (migrates to `formProcessGroup`), collapsed group shadow fix.
