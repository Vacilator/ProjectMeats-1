## Recording Payments

### Step-by-Step Workflow

#### 1. View Outstanding Orders/Invoices

- Navigate to the appropriate accounting page
- Use filters to focus on **Unpaid** or **Partial** items
- Outstanding amounts are displayed in the **Outstanding** column
- Status badges use color coding:
  - 🔴 **Red** = Unpaid (full balance due)
  - 🟡 **Yellow** = Partial (some payments received)
  - 🟢 **Green** = Paid (balance cleared)

#### 2. Open the Side Panel

- Click any row in the table to open the **side panel** (400px width)
- Panel displays:
  - Entity reference number (PO#, SO#, or Invoice#)
  - Supplier/Customer name
  - Order/Invoice date
  - **Financial Summary**: Total amount and Outstanding balance
  - **Payment Status** badge
  - Notes (if any)
  - **Activity Log** (recent activity feed)

#### 3. Click "Record Payment" Button

- Button location: **Top-right of side panel header** (before × close button)
- Button appearance: Green background with 💰 icon
- Button visibility:
  - **Payables/Receivables**: Hidden when `payment_status === 'paid'`
  - **Invoices**: Hidden when `status === 'paid'` OR `status === 'cancelled'`

#### 4. Fill Payment Details in Modal

**Payment Modal Fields:**

| Field | Description | Required | Validation |
|-------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **Amount** | Payment amount received/made | ✅ Yes | Must be > 0 and ≤ outstanding balance |
| **Payment Method** | How payment was received | ✅ Yes | Check / Wire Transfer / ACH / Credit Card / Cash / Other |
| **Reference Number** | Check# or confirmation# | ❌ No | Free text (e.g., "CHK-12345" or "WIRE-98765") |
| **Payment Date** | Date payment was received | ✅ Yes | Cannot be future date (max = today) |
| **Notes** | Additional context | ❌ No | Free text (e.g., "Partial payment per agreement") |

**Pre-filled Values:**
- **Amount**: Automatically pre-filled with **outstanding balance**
- **Payment Date**: Defaults to **today's date**

**Example Use Cases:**

**Scenario 1: Full Payment**
- Total: $10,000.00
- Outstanding: $10,000.00
- Action: Accept pre-filled $10,000.00, select payment method, submit
- Result: Status changes to **PAID** ✅

**Scenario 2: Partial Payment**
- Total: $10,000.00
- Outstanding: $10,000.00
- Action: Change amount to $5,000.00, select payment method, add note "First installment"
- Result: Status changes to **PARTIAL** 🟡, Outstanding updates to $5,000.00

**Scenario 3: Second Partial Payment**
- Total: $10,000.00
- Outstanding: $5,000.00 (after first payment)
- Action: Enter $5,000.00, select payment method, submit
- Result: Status changes to **PAID** ✅, Outstanding updates to $0.00

#### 5. Submit and Verify

- System validates input (see [Validation Rules](#validation-rules))
- On success:
  - Modal closes automatically
  - Side panel refreshes with updated data
  - Table row updates with new status badge
  - Outstanding balance decreases
- On error:
  - Red error message appears in modal
  - Fix validation issues and resubmit

## Payment Status Indicators

### Status Badge Colors

The system uses **semantic colors** for universal recognition:

| Badge Color | Status | Meaning | Outstanding Amount |
|-------------|--------|---------|-------------------|
| 🔴 **Red** | UNPAID | No payments received | = Total Amount |
| 🟡 **Yellow** | PARTIAL | Some payments received | > $0 and < Total |
| 🟢 **Green** | PAID | Fully paid | $0.00 |

### Status Transitions

```
UNPAID (Red)
  ↓
  │ Record partial payment (< outstanding balance)
  ↓
PARTIAL (Yellow)
  ↓
  │ Record final payment (= outstanding balance)
  ↓
PAID (Green)
```

**Automatic Status Updates:**
- Status changes happen **immediately** after payment submission
- Backend calculates new outstanding balance: `Total - Sum(All Payments)`
- Frontend updates badge color based on new status

---

## Payment Methods

### Available Options

| Method | Description | Reference Number Example |
|--------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Check** | Paper or electronic check | CHK-12345 |
| **Wire Transfer** | Bank wire transfer | WIRE-98765 |
| **ACH** | Automated Clearing House | ACH-202601150001 |
| **Credit Card** | Card payment | *Last 4 digits: 4532* |
| **Cash** | Cash payment | N/A |
| **Other** | Other payment methods | Custom reference |

**Best Practices:**
- Always include reference numbers for **Check** and **Wire Transfer**
- For ACH, include transaction ID from bank
- For credit card, use last 4 digits or transaction ID
- Cash payments may not need reference numbers

---

## Validation Rules

### Amount Validation

**Rules:**
- ✅ Amount must be **greater than 0**
- ✅ Amount must be **less than or equal to outstanding balance**
- ❌ Cannot record $0.00 payment
- ❌ Cannot record payment exceeding outstanding balance

**Error Messages:**
```
"Amount must be greater than 0"
"Amount cannot exceed outstanding balance ($X,XXX.XX)"
```

**Examples:**

| Outstanding | Input | Valid? | Reason |
|-------------|-------|--------|--------|
| $10,000.00 | $5,000.00 | ✅ Yes | Within range |
| $10,000.00 | $10,000.00 | ✅ Yes | Full payment |
| $10,000.00 | $15,000.00 | ❌ No | Exceeds outstanding |
| $10,000.00 | $0.00 | ❌ No | Must be > 0 |
| $10,000.00 | -$500.00 | ❌ No | Must be positive |

### Payment Date Validation

**Rules:**
- ✅ Date must be **today or earlier**
- ❌ Cannot record future-dated payments

**Reason:** Prevents accidental data entry errors and maintains accurate financial records.

### Required Fields

**Must Fill:**
- Amount
- Payment Method
- Payment Date

**Optional:**
- Reference Number (but **strongly recommended** for check/wire)
- Notes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: "Record Payment" Button Not Visible

**Possible Causes:**
1. Order/Invoice is already fully paid
2. Invoice status is "Cancelled"

**Solution:**
- Check payment status badge in table
- If already **PAID** (green), no action needed
- If **CANCELLED**, payments cannot be recorded

---

#### Issue 2: Modal Shows "Amount cannot exceed outstanding balance"

**Cause:** Entered amount > outstanding balance

**Solution:**
- Verify outstanding balance in side panel: **Financial Summary → Outstanding**
- Adjust payment amount to be ≤ outstanding
- If paying in full, click pre-filled amount (should match outstanding)

---

#### Issue 3: Payment Submitted but Status Not Updating

**Possible Causes:**
1. Browser not refreshing data
2. Backend error (check Network tab)

**Solution:**
- Close and re-open side panel to refresh
- Hard refresh page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check browser console for errors
- Contact IT support if issue persists

---

#### Issue 4: Cannot Select Future Payment Date

**Cause:** Date picker enforces `max={today}` validation

**Solution:**
- This is **by design** to prevent data entry errors
- If payment was truly received today, use today's date
- If recording historical payment, select the actual past date

---

#### Issue 5: Modal Closes Immediately After Opening

**Cause:** Likely clicking "Record Payment" multiple times rapidly

**Solution:**
- Open side panel again
- Click "Record Payment" **once**
- Wait for modal to fully render before interacting

## Backend Integration

### API Endpoint

**POST** `/api/v1/payments/`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "purchase_order": 123,      // OR sales_order OR invoice (only one)
  "amount": "5000.00",
  "payment_method": "check",
  "reference_number": "CHK-12345",
  "payment_date": "2026-01-15",
  "notes": "Partial payment per agreement"
}
```

**Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "id": 456,
  "purchase_order": 123,
  "amount": "5000.00",
  "payment_method": "check",
  "reference_number": "CHK-12345",
  "payment_date": "2026-01-15",

### Database Schema

**PaymentTransaction Model:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | Integer | Primary key |
| `tenant` | ForeignKey | Tenant isolation |
| `purchase_order` | ForeignKey (nullable) | Link to PO (if applicable) |
| `sales_order` | ForeignKey (nullable) | Link to SO (if applicable) |
| `invoice` | ForeignKey (nullable) | Link to Invoice (if applicable) |
| `amount` | Decimal(12,2) | Payment amount |
| `payment_method` | CharField | check/wire/ach/credit_card/cash/other |
| `reference_number` | CharField | Check# or confirmation# |
| `payment_date` | DateField | Date payment received |
| `notes` | TextField | Optional notes |
| `created_at` | DateTimeField | Timestamp |
| `created_by` | ForeignKey | User who recorded payment |

**Polymorphic Pattern:**
- Only **one** of `purchase_order`, `sales_order`, `invoice` should be set
- The non-null FK determines the parent entity

---

### Auto-Calculation Logic

**On PaymentTransaction.save():**

1. **Sum all payments** for parent entity:
   ```python
   total_paid = parent.payments.aggregate(Sum('amount'))['amount__sum'] or Decimal('0.00')
   ```

2. **Calculate outstanding balance:**
   ```python
   outstanding = parent.total_amount - total_paid
   ```

3. **Update payment_status:**
   - If `outstanding == 0`: `payment_status = 'paid'`
   - If `0 < outstanding < total`: `payment_status = 'partial'`
   - If `outstanding == total`: `payment_status = 'unpaid'`

4. **Save parent entity:**
   ```python
   parent.outstanding_amount = outstanding
   parent.payment_status = status
   parent.save()
   ```

**Additional Logic (Invoices Only):**
- If `payment_status == 'paid'`, also set `invoice.status = 'paid'`
