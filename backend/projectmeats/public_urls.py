"""
Legacy public schema URL configuration for ProjectMeats.

⚠️ WARNING: This file is NOT CURRENTLY USED ⚠️

This file is a legacy artifact from a previous django-tenants implementation
that used schema-based multi-tenancy. ProjectMeats now uses a shared-schema
approach with tenant_id foreign keys for data isolation.

CURRENT ARCHITECTURE:
- Using custom TenantMiddleware (apps.tenants.middleware.TenantMiddleware)
- ALL requests use projectmeats.urls (ROOT_URLCONF)
- Tenant isolation via tenant_id foreign keys on business models
- NO django-tenants or schema-based routing

This file is kept for historical reference but serves no active purpose.
It can be safely deleted in future cleanup efforts.
