DEPRECATED: This command was used for django-tenants schema-based multi-tenancy.

ProjectMeats has migrated to SHARED-SCHEMA multi-tenancy where:
- All tenants share one PostgreSQL schema
- Tenant isolation is via tenant_id ForeignKeys
- No Client/Domain models from django-tenants

This command is preserved for historical reference only.
